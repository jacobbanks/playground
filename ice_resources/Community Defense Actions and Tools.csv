Federal agents are doing their best to terrorize our communities, but we are not afraid! We’ve set up a Community Defense Center at the MacArthur Park Home Depot at 1675 Wilshire Boulevard, and we need volunteers to help us man the booth, conduct patrols, and share resources with the community.

We’ll be here from 7am to 12pm EVERY DAY until we chase these fascist feds out of our city. Hot spots will be provided for those who work from home, and we’ll be purchasing food to share from local vendors. JOIN US!!"

If yes, call (626) 799-3566 Maybe it was a family member, a neighbor, a coworker, or someone from your community. Many people have disappear overnight, without being able to say goodbye, and their loved ones are left without answers. That’s why it is urgent to identify and locate those who have been detained or deported. From our office, we are working to provide legal support, emotional assistance, and direct help to those who have been deported or are at risk. But to do this, we need your help. If you know someone who was detained or deported, please contact us at: 626-799-3566 Your information could make all the difference. We can help track their whereabouts, connect them with organizations, support their families here, and in some cases even explore options for return or legal protection. No one should face this alone. The persecution of migrants is real—but so is our power to organize, to care for one another, and to defend our dignity."
