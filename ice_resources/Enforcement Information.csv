The Natural History Museum notified staff that LAPD will use the park's Pink and Yellow parking lots ""to stage vehicles and to check in their personnel"" through early next week, per a message from Exposition Park Management.The museum's email to employees acknowledged the ""visible presence may raise questions or concerns"" and reminded staff that ""LAPD is prohibited from engaging in immigration enforcement activities.""Two LAPD public information officers told us they have no information about the operation. One officer noted that ""doesn't mean it's not coming down the pipe,"" just that they haven't received any information on it as of yet.The nature of the operation requiring 300+ police vehicles was not specified in the communications. Exposition Park houses the California Science Center, Natural History Museum, and is adjacent to USC. The park is managed by the state of California."
