Clue Justice LA,DETAINED IMMIGRANT BOND FUND,https://www.cluejustice.org/detained-immigrant-bond-fund/,@cluejustice,CLUE’s Detained Immigrant Bond Fund provides financial support to help secure the release of detained community members from immigration detention.
,Family Fundraiser,https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-aid-for-families-of-14-detained-members,,"Urgent Aid for LA Families of 14 Detained by ICE - Dear Community, we are reeling from the recent arrests of fourteen of our beloved fathers, sons, brothers, uncles: Tomas, Juan Fernando, Jose Paulino, Jacob, Miguel, Oscar, Uriel, Lazaro, Felimon, Ismael, Reynaldo, Luiz, Mario, and Jorge. Ranging in ages from 24 to 56.

What was a normal workday for them became a nightmare when ICE raided the Ambiance warehouse in Downtown LA and enacted illegal mass collateral arrests where our relatives were unjustly arrested and kidnapped.

In our most dire moment of need, we turn to our chosen family and community for support as our family is facing urgent need for financial support. The kidnapping of 14 of our loved ones in one swoop is leaving fifteen families with young children, elders who rely on their caretaking, without their primary breadwinners and exacerbating existing struggles to make ends meet.

Sadly one of our fourteen are now in San Isidro (we will still fight for their return), and are now securing legal representation for the others who we hope can be released on bond soon. We anticipate bond to be set between $1,500-$5K per person!! While we support them through this process, their families are left without their primary breadwinner and need financial support for daily childcare, food and bill expenses while they are detained.

The organizer of this fundraiser is directly related to three of the 14 families, but all are part of the broader Zapotec community and have authorized the organizer to gather and distribute funds under their guidance.


The funds will go towards immediate material needs of families, which include paying rent, securing groceries, medications, transportation costs, childcare, baby formula, diapers, and the like, depending on the needs of each individual household.

We are thankful for any amount that will go a long way for us right now. For more daily updates and ways to support please follow @LuchaZapoteca on instagram.

With gratitude and solidarity,

The Zapotec Community"

She worked hard selling tacos on the streets of Ladera Heights in Los Angeles, doing what she could to support her family. But on Monday, everything changed. While working outside Home Depot, Celina was suddenly attacked by several masked men who forced her into a car and drove off. She is now in an ICE detention center away from her family. Carlos, a day laborer is now left alone, caring for their young son, who keeps asking when his mamá will come home. Celina is a mother, a partner, and a beloved member of her community. She deserves to be safe. Her family urgently needs our support. They are navigating this nightmare and will need legal help, and stability.

Help Free Isaac from ICE Detention,legal aid,https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-help-needed-support-isaacs-legal-fight-against-ice,NDLON,"Isaac has lived in the United States for well over a decade. He studied culinary arts and worked in restaurants across Los Angeles. In the early morning hours of June 18, he was kidnapped by masked officers in an ICE raid while waiting with his coworkers to be picked up for a job. Isaac has built a life here, a community, and a future. But all of that is now at risk. Isaac has now been detained for over two weeks. He has a bond hearing soon, but no way to pay bond if granted. Please donate what you can—no amount is too small. Funds will go to cover bond if granted, legal costs, and to help Isaac get back on his feet after detention. Your support could make the difference between freedom and permanent separation from the life Isaac built in the U.S."
Petition Home Depot,Petition for Boycott,https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/tell-home-depot-get-ice-out-now,NDLON,"Every day, ICE agents are targeting day laborers in Home Depot parking lots—detaining and deporting workers who are just trying to survive. This is a human rights crisis. Masked men, armed and unaccountable, are terrorizing workers, customers, and surrounding communities. This is happening on Home Depot’s watch, on its property, with its silence. We demand that Home Depot immediately: Publicly condemn ICE raids on its property. Prohibit federal immigration enforcement from using its parking lots to target day laborers. Commit to creating safe, welcoming spaces for all people regardless of status. If anyone is unsafe in their stores, then we are all unsafe. If Home Depot stays silent, it will be complicit. And it will face not only moral shame—but the loss of trust and business across the U.S. and beyond."

On the morning of June 28th, 2025, in Pasadena, California, Rosalina was unjustly detained by federal immigration agents. Agents claimed to be searching for someone else, but still took Rosalina into custody — despite having no reason to do so. Even more devastating, this happened in front of her children. Rosalina is a deeply loved member of our community — a hardworking mother doing everything she can to build a better life for her kids. She has worked tirelessly as a caregiver for the elderly, offering comfort, companionship, and dignity to those most in need.

Oscar Bermudes Community Defense Fund,legal aid fundraising,https://www.gofundme.com/f/oscar-bermudes-community-defense-fund,NDLON,"Solidarity with Oscar Bermudes and his family! While driving his work truck in 2023, our friend Oscar’s GPS took him to Canada for just a few minutes - he’s been fighting his deportation ever since. The Bermudes family moved to Kearny from El Salvador almost twenty years ago. Oscar and his family are community organizers with Movimiento Cosecha New Jersey. At the height of the Covid pandemic, Oscar and his wife Maria delivered food to immigrant families who were hit the hardest. If you've ever been to a Cosecha event and had great pupusas, it’s likely that they were Maria’s. Maria and Oscar are madly in love, and often speak directly to each other when they speak at our protests and rallies. They recently renewed their commitment to each other in September 2024. They have 3 beautiful children (Liseth, Oscar Jr. and Angelito) who are asking for your support. As a community, we are the primary line of defense and we’re not going to let any president intimidate us into fear. As the Trump administration begins its war on immigrant communities across the country, we need to make sure that Oscar and his family have the support they need. Oscar has had to miss work while dealing with the logistics of his case, and several members of his family have serious health conditions. As Oscar and his family prepare for his next ICE check-in, we want to make sure that they won’t have to worry about life expenses and his wife’s medical bills. We appreciate your support and solidarity. Please share this fundraiser widely."
Justice for Jorge: Fighting Back Against ICE Detentio,legal aid fundraising,https://www.gofundme.com/f/justice-for-jorge-fighting-back-against-ice-detention?attribution_id=sl:cc37969a-c1b2-451a-b25d-c1781fcf3b04&lang=en_US&utm_campaign=man_ss_icons&utm_medium=customer&utm_source=copy_link,NDLON,"Jorge is a 22-year-old asylum seeker from Venezuela who has already survived more than anyone should have to endure. He fled his homeland to escape extreme violence, political and economic turmoil, and life-threatening conditions—risking everything in search of safety. Now, instead of being met with compassion, he has been unjustly detained by ICE. On February 19, 2025, Jorge received a call from ICE instructing him to report the next day. He complied, as he has always done throughout his asylum process. But when he arrived on February 20, he was informed that his case was undergoing “custody redetermination.” Instead of being released, he was sent to the Northwest Detention Center (NW ICE Processing Center), where he now awaits his court date. On March 20, Jorge has his master calendar hearing, in which he will be requesting a bond - which could be as high as $15,000. Jorge’s journey to the U.S. has been one of immense hardship and courage. After fleeing Venezuela, he first sought refuge in Colombia, then Ecuador, only to face further violence and instability. Determined to find safety, he crossed the Darién Gap—not once, but twice—enduring extortion, threats, and the horrors of a migration route where too many lose their lives. His choice to come to the U.S. was not made lightly—it was a desperate attempt to survive, build a future, and support his family. Jorge is a beloved member of our community. Everyone who knows him can attest to his kindness, his infectious joy, and his unwavering strength. He is actively involved in his community at large through his dedication to faith work with his church: Iglesia de Jesucristo Pentecostal de Las Tinieblas a La Luz. He loves dancing bachata and playing any type of sport. He is a dedicated friend who would do anything to help those around him. In addition, Jorge has been an active leader at Voz Workers’ Rights Education Project since March 2024. He’s traveled with Voz to New Jersey for the Somos Más Asamblea with the National Day Labor Organizing Network, graduated from their Emergency Preparedness Cohort, and completed the accredited irrigation program in partnership with Portland Community College. He has stepped up in leadership and job training programs, demonstrating resilience, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to building a better future—for himself and the community Jorge’s detention is unjust, and part of a broader system that criminalizes migrants and day laborers. We know that solo el pueblo salva al pueblo, and we will not stand by while our people are taken. Please DONATE to cover legal fees, bond if granted, lost wages, funds for commissary expenses, travel costs for loved ones in Oregon to visit him, and financial relief for his family. Every dollar raised will help protect Jorge’s future, whether he remains in the U.S. or faces deportation. DONATE & SHARE! THANK YOU!"

He’s a hardworking day laborer who simply wanted a better life for himself and his family. But last week, while standing at a corner in Pasadena looking for work, Carlos was suddenly picked up by ICE. No warning. No cause. Just taken. Now he’s sitting in detention, completely isolated and vulnerable, with no way to defend himself. He’s never had an immigration case. He’s not a threat—he’s a father, a worker, a human being who deserves dignity and due process. To make matters worse, Carlos has been experiencing sudden fainting spells, and his family is worried about his health. He has no access to proper medical care in detention. Carlos urgently needs a lawyer to fight his deportation—but immigration attorneys are expensive. Please donate to help with his fees. No one should be ripped from their community just for trying to work. Let’s show Carlos that he is not alone."
