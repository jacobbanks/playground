Normalization of Authoritarian Oppression,NYTimes,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKw9SpNxC6x/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==,"Masha Gessen, a journalist and expert on authoritarianism, warns that “the most dangerous phase” in the decline of democracy is normalization. This is the stage when repeated violations of democratic norms—actions that once shocked us—become part of everyday life. According to Gessen, normalization dulls our outrage and lowers our expectations, making it easier for undemocratic behavior to continue unchecked. Gessen explains that, over time, society adapts to each new breach of democratic standards. What was once unthinkable becomes routine, and people adjust their behavior and expectations. This process allows autocratic leaders to consolidate power, as fewer people remain willing to resist or speak out. To counter normalization, Gessen urges us to remain vigilant: keep recognizing and naming undemocratic actions, and don’t let our standards slip. As she writes, “life moved forward, and the shocking occurrences became entrenched in our reality.” We must not let the unacceptable become our new normal."

SoCal groups sued DHS for ICE abductions,@public_counsel,https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnmuLlhZbx/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==,"Southern California residents, workers, and advocacy groups have sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in federal court for abducting and disappearing community members using unlawful stop and arrest practices and confining individuals at a federal building in illegal conditions while denying them access to attorneys. The suit alleges that DHS has unconstitutionally arrested and detained people in order to meet arbitrary arrest quotas set by the Trump administration.

Since June 6, the federal government has unleashed immigration agents onto the streets, worksites, and neighborhoods of Los Angeles and surrounding counties, creating a siege and immigration dragnet over the region. The suit notes, “one of the clearest patterns that have emerged in the raids in Southern California […] has been stops and interrogations […] on the basis of apparent race and ethnicity.”

Agents have been abducting individuals en masse and taking them to the basement of a federal building in downtown L.A., commonly referred to as “B-18,” which lacks beds, showers, or medical facilities. The facility was designed to hold a small number of people temporarily so they can be processed and released, or processed and transported to a long-term detention facility.

The ongoing raids have led to the disappearance of more than 1,500 people. The suit details how federal agents consistently refuse to identify themselves or what agency they are with when asked, using anonymity as a tactic to shield lawlessness.

Immigrants with no criminal convictions represent sharpest growth in ICE detention population,@laistofficial,https://www.instagram.com/p/DLtIiHgsWd2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==,"President Trump is enacting a mass deportation campaign promised to be the largest in U.S. history. New data is giving a clearer picture of exactly what that looks like: at least 56,000 immigrants are being held in ICE detention.

According to the Deportation Data Project, a group that collects immigration numbers, about half the people in detention don't have criminal convictions.

That's close to 30,000 people in detention, without a criminal record — the group that has grown the most in recent months."

Vets About Face: You Can Resist,@vetsaboutface,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DL2i5Z0RHXF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,"Yesterday’s heavily militarized operation in McArthur Park, a predominantly Mexican, Central American, and immigrant community in LA, was one more step by the Federal government to normalize a constant state of fear and the threat of violence on these communities and anyone that supports them. Immigrant communities have been victimized twice: First they flee their homelands due to conditions often created or exacerbated by U.S. policy, only to be kidnapped and deported by the same government that led them to flee their homes in the first place. In 2018, Maggie Martin, a member of About Face, traveled to Tijuana, Mexico with a small group of grassroots leaders to meet with migrant families, asylum seekers, and allies on the ground. Maggie shares how U.S. service members can resist militarization of the border and our communities. If you are in the military you have a Right to Refuse deploying in an immoral and likely unconstitutional mission threatening basic human rights.
